Fish burger – Filet “no” Fish

6 buns
300 g tofu
2 tsp garlic powder
50 g cashew nuts
600 g can chickpeas (240g drained and rinsed)
2 tbsp Nori powder
1.50 tsp salt

INGREDIENTS - BREADCRUMB MIX
80 g panko breadcrumbs
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp paprika
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
½ tsp salt
INGREDIENTS - BREADING FOR THE BURGERS
40 g flour
2 flax eggs (2 tbsp ground flax seeds: 6 tbsp water)
8 tbsp oat milk
oil for frying
TARTARE SAUCE
250 g vegan mayo

4 tbsp capers
4 tbsp gherkins
3 tbsp chopped parsley

Fill and boil the kettle. In a bowl cover the cashew nuts with boiling water and leave to soak while you prepare the other ingredients. Ideally leave them soak for 10 mins.
You can make your tartare sauce ahead by roughly chopping the capers, the gherkins and the parsley and mixing through the vegan mayo and mustard. Leave in the fridge until your fillet no fish burgers are cooked.
To make the burgers drain and rinse the chickpeas, drain the cashew nuts, press the firm tofu to remove any excess moisture. In a food processor add the chickpeas, tofu, nori, salt and spices and the drained cashew nuts and pulse blend till smooth but that there is a little texture.
Remove from the food processor and shape into 4 square shaped burgers (approx 100-120g each).
Blend the breadcrumb mixture so it is very fine breadcrumbs.
To make your flax egg - in a cup mix with a fork the ground flaxseed with the water. Set aside to thicken, then mix with the oat milk.
To set up your breading station; put the flour in a large flat bowl or plate, Transfer your flax eggs/milk to another flat bowl or large plate, in a third flat bowl mix the breadcrumbs, turmeric, paprika, nutritional yeast and salt.
First dip one burger at a time in the flour (cover completely) , then using another hand move to the flax egg/milk plate and coat well on all sides, finally move the fingers to the breadcrumb plate and gently coat with the breadcrumbs on all sides (using your clean non flax egg hand to do this last stage will make this so much easier). Repeat until you have coated all the burgers. If your burgers are delicate simply use a burger turner and carefully coat the burgers.
